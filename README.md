# Code Highlighter

Highlights your code in your browser using <a href="https://highlightjs.org/">higlight.js</a>,
I made this so viewing websites with raw data would be easier.

# Limitations

Only highlights the code inside a ```<pre>``` AND ```<code>``` tag.

# Possible Problems

It adds a ```<code>``` tag inside the ```<pre>``` tag if none exists yet, so if there isn't supposed to be a ```<code>``` tag after the ```<pre>``` tag, it might break something.
